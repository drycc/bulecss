# bulecss

Bulecss is a CSS framework to build and style Drycc products.

Bulecss provides guidelines for the aesthetic, function, and form of user interfaces to provide a consistent experience for our customers. This is a living document and is under constant iteration.

The design of bulecss draws inspiration from Heroku's purple3.
